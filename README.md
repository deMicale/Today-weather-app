# Today-weather-app 

Today-weather-app has the goal:
- to show the daily weather forecast in each Italian province and in the most important holiday cities;
- to help turists to choose their holiday city when they arrive in Italy;

Thanks to its responsive layout, my app is simple to use. After having chosen the city you want to visit by scrolling the drop-down in the search bar, 
you will see a  single card with the city name at the top, the weather icon at the centre and some further information like speed wind, humidity and temperature at the bottom.
If you don't choose any city, the app will display the weather forecast in all cities, by default.

I wish you will enjoy my app!
